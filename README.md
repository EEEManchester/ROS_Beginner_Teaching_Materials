# ROS Beginner Teaching Materials
This is a 5 part series of guides to help you install and use Linux and the Robotic
operating system(ROS). By going through each guide in order, you should get a good
overview of using both Linux and ROS. These documents were created by Toluwani Soboyejo,
Abdu-Allah Awad and Jessica Paterson. If you find any errors please let us know.

# Using GitHub
GitHub is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers.
This allows us to create a space for all of the necessary documents, images and
information while giving you (our readers) quick and easy access to all of that
information **(for free)**. 

We assume that users of the guide have no prior knowledge of Linux, ROS or even
Git/Github. With this in mind here is some basic information about GitHub that may help
you out when using these guides.

**Key functions:**
* You will notice that there is a series of 3 parallel lines in the top left corner of
  the box this document is in, (right next to where it says README.md).
  Press this to easily navigate through the document to the sections you need.

* These guides feature code blocks for you to copy and paste your Linux terminal.
  An easy way to do so on Github is to hover over the code block. On the right-hand side a
  clipboard symbol will appear, clicking on this will copy the contents to your clipboard.
  You can test this on the code block below.

```
  Copy me.
```

Other than the above there isn't much more that can be explained simply in this
document, so instead here are 3 links that will help you understand and use GitHub
easily. **It is not necessary to go through these to understand the guide, but the links
are here to give you a better understanding of Git and GitHub if you need it.**
  
  * Firstly, [Github's "Github guide"](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).
    This will give a good idea of what Github is about, and how to use it.
  * [Microsoft intro to Git](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-git/)
    This is a guide for git made by Microsoft.
  * [Git youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVRQoVRzMIY)
    This video has timestamps and a basic overview of the main aspects of Git to know.
