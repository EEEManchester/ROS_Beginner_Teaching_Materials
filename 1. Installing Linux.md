# Installing Linux
In this guide we will be going through how to install and run Linux Ubuntu 18.04 in 3 ways. 

1) Via **dual boot** on your Personal computer (PC) - this is where you install the
Linux operating system (OS), such that it runs the Linux OS as well as your own Windows
Installation. You can switch between the operating systems at reboot.

2) Via **full installation** on your PC - this is where you install the Linux OS as the
**only** operating system running on your PC. **Warning: this will wipe out all exiting
OS, programs, files etc...**

3) Via a **virtual machine (VM)** running on your PC - here you download software that
emulates the Linux environment. You can also download VM's that have both Linux and the
Robotic operating system (ROS) pre-installed although that is not provided by this guide. 

On the surface this may seem like an easy task but there are a lot of issues that you may
face along the way. We will highlight some of the issues we encountered and offer
solutions, so you don't have to go through the stress that unknown errors bring. Further
help will be provided at the end of this guide to make using the installed Linux an easy
process. **p.s. Ubuntu 18.04 is required to run ROS melodic, So be careful not to install
the shiny new version of Ubuntu, as you will have issues running ROS melodic.**

## Options 1 & 2 (Installation via dual boot / Full installation)
**It is advisable to make backup copies of all of your important files before proceeding
with the download and installation of Linux OS. If you intend to dual boot you could
accidentally wipe/corrupt your Windows installation so make sure you save your files
onto a USB hard drive, Google drive, or another form of your choosing. It is possible to
clone your entire Windows installation onto an external drive, but that is beyond the scope of
this guide.**

To use either of these methods you will need:
1) Your PC.
2) A USB stick with a minimum storage of 4 GB (Check on USB or through PC).
3) A bootable software, we personally recommend **Rufus** - follow this [Rufus install](https://rufus.ie/en/) link and select the latest stable version to download.

![Rufus_download](Linux_guide_pics/Rufus_download.PNG)

### Preparing the bootable USB Stick
To use the USB as a medium to install Linux, the USB must first be made bootable. This process is described below.

**Warning:** The contents of your USB will be deleted, so make sure it is empty or you have a backup of it's content.

1. Download Ubuntu 18.04 **desktop image**:
  * For 64-bit computers go to http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/ and download the
    ubuntu-18.04.6-desktop-amd64.iso aka the 64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop image.
    *AMD in this context does not refer to your processor manufacturer, so even if
    you have an Intel processor, you still require the AMD64 image.*

    ![Ubuntu_desktop_image](Linux_guide_pics/Ubuntu_desktop_image.PNG)

  * For 32-bit PCs go to https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-mate/releases/18.04/release/
    and download the ubuntu-mate-18.04.5-desktop-i386.iso aka 32-bit PC (i386) desktop
    image. *This image is for any 32-bit processor, Intel or AMD.* Ubuntu Mate is
    identical to Ubuntu in all the ways that matter but it looks very different to the
    screenshots of Ubuntu you will find in this guide.
  
    If you are not sure whether you have a 32-bit or 64-bit machine please search how to
    check this in your version of Windows. On Windows 10 this information can be found by
    clicking the Start button -> Settings (Gear Icon above the power icon) -> System -> About

2. Plug in your USB drive and open the Rufus software
3. Make sure that the following is selected for each section:
    * Under **Device**, select your **USB drive**.
    * Under **Boot selection** select and navigate to the **.iso Ubuntu desktop image** that you downloaded in step 1. 
    * Under **Partition scheme** select **MBR**.
    * Under **Target system** select **BIOS or UEFI**.

        ![Desired_Rufus_Input](Linux_guide_pics/Desired_Rufus_Input.PNG)

4. Click **start** and wait until the process is complete. You may get a prompt informing you that the disk image is an **'iso hybrid'** and a recommendation to install it as a .iso image - **choose the .iso image option**. Rufus may also give you a prompt seeking permission to download further files - **click agree/yes**.

Once completed, you will have a bootable USB drive that you can use to run and install Linux.

### Booting from the USB 
To install the Ubuntu operating system, you will need to have the USB drive plugged in
while booting up the PC. You will also need to know which key to press to enter the Boot
Menu. Once the computer has begun to start up you will need to click that key like your
life depends on it.

Please refer to the [How to access your BIOS/Boot
menu](#How-to-access-your-BIOS/Boot-menu) section for details on how to access your
BIOS/Boot Menu.

Once you've found yourself at the Boot Menu (in the BIOS) you will either need to move the **Boot from USB drive** to the **top of the list**, or select **USB drive**.

If the install for Linux doesn't appear and the computer still runs Windows, you can temporarily disable the **Windows boot manager** in the BIOS, then try again.

**Note:** It is a good idea to make a note of which BIOS settings you have altered or take
a photo of your screen with your phone before you start changing things, so you undo anything later.

### Linux Install
Once your PC has booted from the USB drive, you will see a purple GNU which you can use to select to boot Ubuntu.

You will be given the option to either run Linux without installation, or to install Linux. Selecting install Linux will take you to the installation guide. You can then pick to install Linux alongside your OS or to erase your disk and install Linux (this will wipe out your current OS along with any files you have such that the only thing is Linux).
![Ubuntu_choice](Linux_guide_pics/Ubuntu_choice.png)

**Warning:** We recommend thinking carefully about whether to run Linux alongside your OS (dual boot), or to erase the disk (erase Windows and all your files), before picking an option, as it will be extremely difficult to change your mind after the process is done. You have been warned!!

Once you have been through the install process and installed Ubuntu please go to 
[Some important things to know once Ubuntu is Installed](#Some-important-things-to-know-once-Ubuntu-is-Installed)


## Installation via virtual machine
If preparing a bootable disk and running it on your PC is too much of a hassle, then you
could, alternatively, run Linux via a virtualisation on your PC. To do this, you will need
to download a virtual machine such as **VMware**. 

Intel Mac users. Instructions are given below for VMWare Player, if you are on an Intel
Mac you should be able to use [VMWare Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html)
or VirtualBox. Instructions are provided for VirtualBox installation (please read the Note
about VirtualBox below for the link to the guide and for some further information), which
should be the same whether you are on Mac or Windows, but they have only been tested on
Windows and Linux host machines. 

Regardless of the software you use to run your VM, you need to **make sure virtualisation is
enabled in your BIOS** otherwise you will receive errors which reference either IntelÂ®
Virtualization Technology VT-x (for Intel processors) or AMD-V (AMD processors). If you
have an Intel Mac you do not have to do this, it should be enabled by default.

Please refer to the [How to access your BIOS/Boot
menu](#How-to-access-your-BIOS/Boot-menu) section for details on how to access your
BIOS.

Which menu you have to access to turn virtualisation on differs greatly from manufacturer to
manufacturer. The best thing to do is to use the search engine of your choice to look up
"*<your PC/Laptop model> virtualisation enable BIOS*". Here is an [external
link](https://2nwiki.2n.cz/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=75202968) with a pretty
comprehensive list of PC manufacturers and a description of how to enable virtualisation.

*Note: if you are unable to use VMWare because you use an IT managed PC/Laptop and have to
use VirtualBox, follow the [**Installing VirtualBox guide** in this
repo](Installing%20VirtualBox.md). We **strongly** recommend not using VirtualBox if you
are new to virtual machines and have a choice, as it can be more challenging to correctly
set up. Once you're done with the VirtualBox guide please return here, to read the
[Some important things to know once Ubuntu is
Installed](#Some-important-things-to-know-once-Ubuntu-is-Installed) section*

1) Download **Ubuntu 18.04 desktop image** by clicking the following link: http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/ and selecting the appropriate desktop version for your PC. This will download a .iso file onto your PC.
2) Download **VMware Workstation Player** from the following link: https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/workstation-player.html p.s. You want to download the suitable one for your current OS. For example the **Windows VM** for a **Windows OS**.
![VM_download_1](Linux_guide_pics/VM_download_1.PNG)
4) Run VMware and, once it has loaded, select **Create a New Virtual Machine**.
5) Select **Installer disc image file (iso)** and browse for the Ubuntu desktop image then click **Next**.
6) Follow the installation guide - you will also be asked to specify the disk size and whether you wish for the virtual disk to be stored as a single file or as multiple files. Here you could just follow the recommended or default settings.

### Common Issues
You may find that the virtual disk keeps crashing due to a few issues
* Not enough space on hard drive - remedied by freeing up space on your hard drive
* You have an anti virus software installed that is conflicted with VMware - remedied by changing the anti virus software
* Too slow? - you may find that navigating the basic Linux interface is slow, this is often due to a lack of available RAM. You can attempt to allocate the VM more RAM by pressing **"Edit virtual machine settings"** in the VM menu (_shown in the first image below_). You will then be greeted with a slider (_shown in the second image below_) that will allow you to change the amount of allocated RAM. **However, be aware that the available RAM is limited and other processes on the computer may slow down if too much RAM is allocated to the VM.** This issue may also be due to having other processes running in the background, so you can also try closing all other Windows and applications to improve speed.

## Some important things to know once Ubuntu is Installed

These are some important things to note and some commonly encounter issues that people
have once they install Ubuntu. Please at least skim read the heading so that if/when they
happen to you, you won't be alarmed! If you encounter any other issues that you think
could be added to this guide please let us know.

### Do not upgrade to a newer version of Ubuntu
Usually Ubuntu will tell you that you have installed an old version of Ubuntu and ask if
you would like to upgrade to a newer version. Click No, obviously you don't want to do that
because you want to use ROS Melodic!

### Problems using sudo apt update
You may encounter an error stating: **"unable to acquire the dpkg frontend lock
(/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend), is another process using it?"**. This means that the OS
is currently searching for updates, so you can't use your package manager. The solution
is to wait a while and let it finish. If it seems like it is taking an unreasonable amount
of time you can try restarting.

Similarly, a Software update pop-up may appear and ask you to
update using the graphical user interface rather than the terminal, just close this
because you will be updating using the command line later in the guide.

## Keyboard layout
Sometimes after installing linux you may find that certain keys are in a differnt position to what you are used to. This may be because the linux you have installed is using a different keyboard layout. 

In order to change your keyboard layout go to **settings** > **Language and Region** > Then click the **'+'** sign and add the keyboard in the languague of your choosing.

![Linux_keyboard](Linux_guide_pics/Linux_keyboard.PNG)

In the case that you have special characters in your password and are unable to login due to the change in keyboard, we will attach mappings of important keys for both the **English(US)** and **English(UK)** keyboards.

**UK English keyboard:**
![UK_keyboard](Linux_guide_pics/UK_keyboard.PNG)

**US English keyboard:**
![US_keyboard](Linux_guide_pics/US_keyboard.PNG)

### Wifi doesn't work

If you installed Ubuntu as a dual boot or main OS you may find that your **Wi-fi is not connecting**.
A few solutions to this include:

1) Simply restarting the computer - this could work if your Linux recognises other networks but fails to connect to them.
2) Connecting the PC to your internet via a wired connection and downloading updates - once connected, open the terminal (by hitting Ctrl+Alt+T) and type into the terminal
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade 
```
* Reboot Ubuntu. 

## How to access your BIOS/Boot menu
These keys are usually either **F1**, **F2**, **F10**, **F12** or **Del**. If you don't know the key you may be able to find out by googling **BIOS key for [*input your computer model*]**. Or just try each of the ones we mentioned at least once.

If your PC isn't taking you to the Boot Menu even though you are pressing the correct keys - this could be due to your PC starting up too quickly. Here are a few methods to get around this:
1) Firstly, the easiest method is to click **restart** (on the desktop start menu) while
holding the **shift key**. This will take you to a menu entitled **Choose an option**
where you will need to press **Troubleshoot** > **Advanced options** > **UEFI Firmware
Settings** and proceed to restart. This will automatically reboot the system into the
BIOS/ UEFI. This is the first tip described in this video: https://youtu.be/yPLvBo5UCv0 -
*thankfully you only need to watch the first minute*.

    ![Choose_option](Linux_guide_pics/Choose_option.png)

3) Alternatively, if you wish to try frantically pressing a key again, you can stop "fast start-up" by navigating to your **control panel** then selecting **Hardware and Sound** > **Power Options**, then press **"choose what the power buttons do"** (located on the left section of the window), this will take you to the **System Settings**. Finally, click the **Change settings that are currently unavailable**, uncheck the **Turn on fast start-up** and click **save changes**. This should give you an opportunity to press the relevant keys to enter the Boot Menu.
![Settings](Linux_guide_pics/Settings.PNG)
5) If the above two methods have not solved the issue then the PC can be forced to go to the menu described in the first method by turning the PC off completely through holding the **power button** until loss of power. Then turn on and off again once it begins to load until the computer begins to run a **recovery process**. Usually after repeating the process 3 times. **Warning: This is a last resort and it could be done a lot easier by using the first method**.
6) For those still struggling here is another video to help reach the BIOS: https://youtu.be/IMr5-mEbhTs.
